### About Me

After working closely with multiple IT projects as a marketer, I revealed the need to create something new myself, learn up-to-date technologies and be able to use them in practice. 

My previous role of the Head of marketing also gave me exceptional skills of communicating with the team and dealing with conflicts effectively, which I consider one of my top soft skills.

And I also believe my ability to learn on the run under pressure and a strong will to make a positive impact on a product development will notably contribute to my future work.
